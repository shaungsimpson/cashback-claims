# cashback-claims
Plugin component of a technical interview code challenge.

This was part of a submitted solution for a technical interview step in a multi phase job interview. The challenge was to 
provide a cashback claim digital solution to a prospective client based on a UI design given, with a few guidelines.

_It was completed within a 3 day period and does not represent a fully polished solution._

The theme component was used for the display of the form on the frontend and 
can be found [here](https://github.com/shaungsimpson/challenge)

Please note that this is a coding sample only and whilst it does function as intended, is not polished and 
therefore not intended for production.
